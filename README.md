Code & Experiences Music League

June 5, 2023

# What is Music League? 

[Music League](https://musicleague.com/) is an application that helps people discover new music through healthy competition 😉 

# How do I participate? 

Step one is to sign in to Music League with a Spotify account : https://app.musicleague.com/ 
You don’t need to use your personal account, feel free to create a new one for this 🎵

Once we’re ready, the Morale Captains will share a link for you to join the league.

In the league, you will see a list of rounds, with the current round being at the top.

When a round is open, you will get a chance to submit a song

You can write a comment when you make a submission, but remember you want to stay anonymous, so don’t give yourself away 👏

Every player has a week to submit, once the deadline approaches, Music League will take all of the submissions and create a Spotify playlist.

You can access the playlist by:
- Receiving a notification through email from Music League
- Clicking on “Listen to Playlist” in the round information

The round will close off after a week of voting. Players will have one week to vote for the songs that other players submitted 

To vote, head to the the round information in the application and click on “Submit your Votes” 
![Button that says to submit your votes](https://github.com/kag728/music-league/assets/42548585/c88c248f-ea72-4c28-8aa5-7b14d94400c6)

Don’t miss the deadline to vote! If you made a submission and don’t vote, your song will be disqualified for the round 😨

When voting, be conscious of how many votes you have to hand out (votes are proportional to the number of players in the league)

Results for the rounds will be published once the voting deadline has passed, and you can view results of all rounds through the “Results” on each round’s info card

You can also access overall league standings through the “standings” tab in the main page

Things to note:
Music League will send you notifications and reminders about round deadlines (when a round is open, reminders to submit a song, when the playlist is available, when voting opens, and when voting ends) you are able to make changes to notifications through your Music League profile.
You can use the web application if you prefer, there is no requirement to install the mobile application.
